# ratemyhouse

Think of RateMyHouse as a combination between Funda and instagram. Users can upload up to 5 video's where they walk you through their house and tell you about all the cool stuff they have. Furthermore they can upload additional sales information (for instance if the house is for sale and contact information). The application functions both as a social media platform and as a real-estate sales platform.

I started RateMyHouse as a side project for sharpening my Node.Js with Mongo and Express and React-Saga skills. The goad was not to deliver perfect code, but to gain insights in the frameworks. Please note the project is far from finished. Some todo's I am currently aware off (not perse in this order):

- Checking filetypes when uploading thumbnails and videos.
- Better typing for Actions.
- More types of featured video's.
- Add search funtionality.
- Add unittests for the backend.
- Add unittests for the Frontend.
- Dozens of minor tweaks.
